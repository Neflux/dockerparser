# Dockerfile inspector
A lightweight tool developed in Python to analyze and improve Dockerfiles, allowing for a more easily reproducible code.
The program parses the Dockerfile contained in the specified folder and inspects all the instructions. Then it will notify the user with all the improvements that are available.
Usage (example): see `python program.py`.
The `docker` folder contains an example Dockerfile with some instructions that could be optimized.
