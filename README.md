# Dockerfile inspector
A lightweight tool developed in Python to analyze and improve Dockerfiles, allowing for a more easily reproducible code.
The program parses the Dockerfile in the specified folder and inspects all the instructions. Then, it will notify the user with all the improvements that are available.
Usage: see `python parser.py -h`.
